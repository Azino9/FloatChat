Overview

FloatChat is a proposed software solution (SIH PS25040) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). It aims to provide a conversational, user-friendly interface over ARGO float datasets, enabling scientists, students, policymakers, and general users to query, explore, visualize, and derive insights from oceanographic data.

Problem Statement

ARGO floats generate a wealth of oceanographic data (temperature, salinity, pressure, etc.) stored in formats such as NetCDF. However:

Non-expert users find it hard to access or query this raw data.

Visualizing trends or answering natural language queries over this data is time-consuming and technical.

Many lack tools that translate queries like "Show me the temperature profiles in the Indian Ocean between 100-200m for the past year" into interactive charts or maps easily.

There is a need for an AI-driven conversational interface that can accept natural language queries, convert them to structured data queries, fetch the relevant ARGO data, and visualize results in accessible ways.

Objectives

Accessibility: Let users interact with oceanographic data via natural language, without needing deep technical skill.

Visualization: Provide dynamic, informative visualizations (maps, depth profiles, time series, etc.).

Interactivity: Enable filtering, drill-downs, data comparisons, and export of graphics/data.

Scalability & Performance: Handle large NetCDF datasets efficiently; respond quickly.

Accuracy & Interpretability: Ensure outputs are scientifically valid and clear (with metadata, units, etc.).

Proposed Solution

FloatChat will be a full-stack web application (with potential companion mobile view) combining:

A frontend conversational chat interface (web UI) where users type natural language.

A backend AI / LLM + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that converts queries to structured DB or API calls.

A data ingestion layer that handles NetCDF files, extracts necessary variables, organizes in efficient storage (e.g. time, location, depth, variables).

A visualization layer (charts, maps, profile plots, heatmaps) to display results.

Optional: user accounts to save queries, dashboards, export data/images.

Key Features
Feature	Description
Natural Language Querying	Users can ask in regular English sentences.
Data Filtering	By spatial bounds (region), time interval, depth, variables.
Visualization Types	Ocean profiles, time-series, maps, heatmaps etc.
File Format Support	NetCDF integration + conversion to accessible formats.
Metadata Display	Units, variable definitions, data source details.
Export Options	Download data (CSV, JSON) and visualizations (PNG, PDF).
Responsiveness & Speed	Backend optimized for large datasets, caching, etc.
Architecture & Technologies

Frontend: React (or Vue/Angular), D3 / Plotly / Chart.js for visualizations.

Backend: Python / Node.js; possibly Flask / FastAPI; or JS with Express.

AI/LLM + RAG: Use open-source LLMs (or APIs) with embedding store (e.g. Pinecone / FAISS) to map natural language → query templates.

Data storage: A processed database (e.g. PostgreSQL, or time-series DB) for efficient query; raw NetCDF files; caching layers.

Visualization server or microservices for heavy rendering if needed.

Hosting & Deployment: Cloud service (AWS / GCP / Azure), or Govt. science infrastructure; ensure scalability.

User Interface & UX Considerations

Clean conversational UI (chat bubble style) with suggestion prompts (“You may ask about salinity trends, temperature, etc.”)

Visualization panel context-aware (switch visualization based on query)

Show loading indicators, progress for large data fetches

Tooltips / info icons for understanding variables / depth, etc.

Mobile support for users on smaller screens

Challenges & Risks

Handling very large datasets and ensuring real-time or tolerably fast responses.

LLM misinterpretation or hallucination — need fallback and validation.

Data gaps, floats missing metadata, versioning of ARGO data etc.

Ensuring correct unit conversions, time zones, coordinate systems.

Usability: natural language parsing can fail for ambiguous queries.

Evaluation & Success Metrics

Query accuracy: % of correct answers vs ground truth for test set of benchmark questions.

Response time: Measure avg latency per query.

User satisfaction / usability testing: feedback from domain experts & non-experts.

Visualization clarity: clarity, interpretability judged via user eval.

System stability: how many crashes/errors over time.

Roadmap & Future Work
Phase	Deliverables
Phase 1 (MVP)	Natural language query → basic variables (temp / salinity) → simple visualizations (time-series, depth profiles)
Phase 2	Add more variables, spatial map visualizations, export features, caching, optimization
Phase 3	User accounts, saved dashboards, more advanced query support (comparisons, multi-variable queries), threshold/alerts
Phase 4	Extend to include more oceanographic datasets beyond ARGO, integrate predictive modeling (e.g. forecast), multilingual support
